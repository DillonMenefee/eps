{"name":"EPS","tagline":"Embedded PowerShell (Templating tool for PowerShell)","body":"EPS\r\n===\r\nEPS (Embedded PowerShell), inspired by erb, is a templating system that embeds PowerShell code into a text document. It is often used to embed PowerShell code in an HTML document, similar to ASP, JSP and PHP.<br/>\r\nThe most common use that the author can image is to render reports based on HTML pages (on Windows platforms). Or it may works for a rails-like or sinatra-like framework that somebody creates for PowerShell.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nEPS allows PowerShell code to be embedded within a pair of <% and %>, or <%= and %>, etc. delimiters. These embedded code blocks are then evaluated in-place (they are replaced by the result of their evaluation).<br/>\r\nCode in <% %> delimiters will be treated as expressions or commands which help to generate text; Code in <%= %> delimiters is treated as values; Text in <%# %> delimiters will be treated as comments which is ignored in compiling process.\r\n\r\nHere's the example:\r\n\r\ntest.eps:\r\n```\r\nHi <%= $name %>\r\n\r\n<%# this is a comment %>\r\nPlease buy me the following items:\r\n<% 1..5 | %{ %>\r\n  - <%= $_ %> pigs ...\r\n<% } %>\r\n\r\nDave is a <% if($true) { %> boy <% } else { %> girl <% } %>. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDave\r\n<%= (Get-Date -f yyyy-MM-dd) %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen type some commands:\r\n```powershell\r\n$text = gc .\\test.eps\r\n$text = $text -join \"`n\"\r\n$name = \"ABC\"\r\nEPS-Render $text\r\n# here it uses non-safe mode\r\n# To use safe mode: using 'EPS-Render $text -safe' can compile in another PowerShell instance\r\n# to avoid variables polluted by current context\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will produce:\r\n```\r\nHi ABC\r\n\r\nPlease buy me the following items:\r\n  - 1 pigs ...\r\n  - 2 pigs ...\r\n  - 3 pigs ...\r\n  - 4 pigs ...\r\n  - 5 pigs ...\r\n\r\nDave is a boy.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDave\r\n2014-06-09\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can use safe mode with data bindings:\r\n```powershell\r\n$text = gc .\\test.eps\r\n$text = $text -join \"`n\"\r\nEPS-Render $text -safe -binding @{ name = \"dave\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\n_NOTE:_\r\nThe sample above is just for current version. It has much space to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Log\r\n\r\n#### June 5, 2014\r\n+ ~~cannot recognize '<%%' and '%%>'~~\r\n+ ~~if whole line is one command, need to neglect its new-line synbol~~\r\n\r\n#### Jun 6, 2014\r\nfixed two issues\r\n\r\nTODO list:\r\n+ html and url encoding\r\n+ ~~parameter context~~\r\n+ other usability improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\nPlease try out and help to find more bugs! \r\nAuthor email: eyaswoo@163.com\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
